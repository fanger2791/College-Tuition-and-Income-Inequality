# Introduction

In recent years, the escalating cost of college tuition in the United States has emerged as a critical issue, intertwining with the broader narrative of rising income inequality. The paper by  Zhifeng Cai and Jonathan Heathcote addresses this pressing concern by examining the relationship between these two phenomena. Utilizing a competitive model of the college market, the study not only uncovers the mechanisms that link rising income inequality to increasing tuition costs but also sheds light on the consequent impacts on college attendance and social mobility.

Central to the paper's findings is the assertion that the surge in U.S. income inequality since the 1990s can account for more than half of the observed increase in average net tuition over the same period. This relationship underscores a critical feedback loop where income disparities not only affect individual capacity to afford higher education but also drive institutional behaviors around tuition setting. Moreover, the paper highlights the detrimental effects of rising tuition on college attendance rates, particularly among lower-income segments, positing significant implications for social mobility and equity.

To build upon the original work of Cai and Heathcote, our project will undertake a reproduction of the study, focusing on two or three of its core aspects. This will involve:

Recreating the Model: We will start by reproducing the competitive college market model used in the original study, ensuring our work is entirely reproducible. This step includes verifying the model's assumptions, computational methods, and data inputs.
